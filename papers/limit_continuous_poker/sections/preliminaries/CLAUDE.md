# Preliminaries Section

## Purpose
Establishes notation, conventions, and game-theoretic concepts used throughout the paper.

## Key Content

### Game-Theoretic Concepts
- Two-player zero-sum games with infinite action spaces
- Value existence guaranteed by Sion's minimax theorem
- Uniqueness defined up to measure-zero sets

### Conventions

**Ante and Pot:**
- Each player antes 0.5 units
- Initial pot = 1 unit
- All bet sizes relative to pot

**Payoffs:**
- Net gain/loss relative to ante
- Check: winner gets +0.5
- Called bet of size s: winner gets +(0.5 + s)

**Inequalities:**
- Boundary points have measure zero, so >= vs > doesn't matter
- Closed/open intervals used interchangeably at probability-zero boundaries

**Monotone Strategies:**
- Stronger hands more likely to call (for fixed bet)
- Smaller bets more likely to be called (for fixed hand)

**Admissibility:**
- Strategy not weakly dominated
- Focus on equilibria where bettor is admissible against monotone calling strategies
