# Conclusion Section

## Purpose
Summarizes key results, discusses practical implications, acknowledges limitations, and suggests future work.

## Key Content

### Summary of Results
1. **Nash Equilibrium**: Unique admissible equilibrium with closed-form expressions
2. **Game Value**: V(r,t) = (1-r³-t³)/(14-2r³-2t³) with symmetry V(r,t)=V(t,r)
3. **Convergence**: Smooth limits to FBCP and NLCP
4. **Parameter Sensitivity**: Counterintuitive strategic interdependencies

### Strategic Insights for Real Poker
- **Stack depth**: Deeper stacks (higher U) favor skilled players
- **Bluffing frequency**: Larger bluffs require fewer bluffing hands for balance
- **Pot odds**: Caller threshold embodies pot odds principle
- **Symmetry**: Duality between raising minimums and constraining maximums

### Limitations
- Single betting round (vs. multi-street poker)
- Uniform hand distribution (vs. discrete card combinations)
- Perfect hand ordering (vs. card removal, shared equity)
- Symmetric information structure

### Future Directions
- Multiple betting rounds with information revelation
- Asymmetric limits (different stack sizes)
- Non-uniform hand distributions
- Discrete bet sizing
- Computational validation tools
- Multi-player extensions
