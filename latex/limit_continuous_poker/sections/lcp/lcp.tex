\section{Limit Continuous Poker (LCP)}
We now introduce a variant where the bettor may choose a bet size $s$ after seeing their hand strength, but where $s$ is bounded by an upper limit $U$ and a lower limit $L$, referred to as the maximum and minimum bet sizes. This variant, called Limit Continuous Poker (or LCP), retains similar rules to NLCP: 

\begin{definition}[LCP]
Two players, the bettor and the caller, are each dealt uniform, independent hand strengths $x, y \in [0, 1]$. After seeing $x$, the bettor chooses between checking (giving payoff $1$ to the higher hand) or betting an amount $s \in [L, U]$. If the bettor bets, the caller must either call (giving payoff $1+2s$ to the higher hand) or fold (giving payoff $1$ to the bettor).
\end{definition}
